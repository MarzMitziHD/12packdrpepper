# a 12 pack of Doctor Pepper: the game: the python script
a text-based "adventure" "game" where you grab a 12-pack of doctor pepper at the store for you and your friend.
# present me giving present you some info
so. this game was my first time actually writing a story, i guess. it's kind of an inside joke between one of my friends and... me, obviously.
to be honest now, this game kind of has a shit story. i wrote this game in mid-2023 and now i'm just creating this readme, 2 days before the new years. happy early new years, to anyone reading this.





...oh yeah, the (unnamed) protagonist is gay. just so you know.
